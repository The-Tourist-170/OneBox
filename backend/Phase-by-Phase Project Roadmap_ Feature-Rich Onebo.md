# Phase-by-Phase Project Roadmap: Feature-Rich Onebox Email Aggregator

Below is a structured, phase-by-phase plan to build your onebox email aggregator (“Reachinbox-like”) using React.js + Vite, Spring Boot, and Tailwind CSS. Each phase lists core tasks, UI/UX notes, and relevant free APIs or open-source libraries.

## **Phase 1: Project Setup \& Architecture**

### Backend (Spring Boot)

- Initialize Spring Boot project with Gradle/Maven.
- Set up PostgreSQL (emails, users) and Dockerized Elasticsearch for email indexing/search.
- Define key entities: User, IMAPAccount, Email, Folder, Label.


- Slack Notification:
    - Use [Slack In
### Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

- Scaffold project with React + Vite.
- Configure Tailwind CSS.
- Create the design system: colors, buttons, inputs, cards, typography.


## **Phase 2: Real-Time IMAP Email Sync**

### Backend

- Use [JavaMail (Jakarta Mail)](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/mail/) for IMAP connection.
    - Connect to multiple IMAP accounts per user.
    - Implement IDLE mode for real-time updates (avoid polling).
- Fetch last 30 days of emails per account.
- Normalize and store emails in PostgreSQL and index in Elasticsearch.
- REST endpoints:
    - `POST /accounts` (add IMAP account)
    - `GET /emails` (list/fetch/filter emails)
    - `DELETE /accounts/{id}` (remove IMAP account)
- **Note:** Use [GreenMail](https://www.icegreen.com/greenmail/) for local IMAP testing.


## **Phase 3: Searchable Storage \& Filtering**

### Backend

- Integrate with locally hosted Elasticsearch (use Docker).
- Index all email metadata and content.
- Filter/search by folder (`INBOX`, `Sent`, etc.) and by account.
- REST endpoints:
    - `GET /emails/search?q=&folder=&accountId=`
- Implement structured logging.


### Frontend

- Build email list/table view.
- Filtering UI: dropdowns for folder/account; search bar (Type-ahead).
- Loading, empty, error states.


## **Phase 4: AI-Based Email Categorization**

### Backend

- Use a free open-source model for text classification, e.g.,
    - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) + [DL4J (Java)](https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/) for Java, or wrap a lightweight Python model.
    - Optionally call [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) (with free tier) or free locally running model using [Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/) via REST.
- Train/fine-tune on sample data for categories: Interested, Meeting Booked, Not Interested, Spam, Out of Office.
- Categorize new emails as they arrive; store category in DB and ES.
- REST:
    - `POST /emails/{id}/categorize` (manual re-categorization)


### Frontend

- Show clear labels/badges per email (color-coded).
- Filter/segment by category.


## **Phase 5: Slack \& Webhook Integrations**

### Backend

- Slack Notification:
    - Use [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) (free).
    - On “Interested” email, send custom message with sender, subject, snippet.
- Webhook Integration:
    - Hit [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) whenever an email is marked Interested.
- REST:
    - `POST /integrations/slack` (save Slack webhook URL)
    - `POST /integrations/webhook` (save external webhook URL)


## **Phase 6: Frontend Email Client**

- Clean, modern inbox interface: list view, details pane, filters.
- Advanced search bar (Elasticsearch powered) with real-time results.
- Categorization controls.
- Integrations management (Slack/Webhooks config screens).
- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI.
- UI feedback for real-time updates (WebSocket or SSE).


## **Phase 7: AI-Powered Suggested Replies**

### Backend

- Store product/outreach agenda in vector DB.
    - Use [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) (open-source, easy to run locally with Java/Python handler).
    - For Java: interact via REST or gRPC to a Python microservice if necessary.
- RAG pipeline:
    - On incoming email, search related vectors, generate context.
    - Use a free LLM for reply suggestion: [OpenAI GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt), limited free tier, or run [ollama](https://ollama.com/) (“llama2”, locally).
- REST:
    - `POST /emails/{id}/suggest-reply`


### Frontend

- Sidebar/modal to display suggested replies (editable before sending!).
- “Copy to clipboard” and “Insert” actions.


## **Phase 8: Deployment**

- Backend: Dockerize Spring Boot + Elasticsearch + Vector DB (ChromaDB).
- Frontend: Dockerized Nginx container or direct Vercel/Netlify deploy.
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate services for local and cloud (e.g., Railway.app, Fly.io, or self-host).
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.


## **Free/Open APIs \& Libraries Aligned with Requirements**

| Need | Free APIs/Libraries | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Email IMAP | Jakarta Mail (JavaMail) | Open-source, reliable |
| Email Search | Elasticsearch (Docker) | Open-source, local deployment |
| AI Categorization | HuggingFace Free API / DL4J / Llama 2 | Free-tier, local or hosted |
| Slack Integration | Slack Incoming Webhooks | Unlimited, free |
| Webhook Integration | webhook.site | 100% free, development use |
| Vector DB for RAG | ChromaDB (local) | Easy setup, open-source |
| LLM for Reply Suggest | Ollama (Llama2), HuggingFace | Local LLM or free-tier API |

## **Extra Tips for a Winning UI/UX**

- Prioritize performance and feedback—e.g., show loading states, IMAP connection status.
- Clearly surface categorization and search results.
- Use modals/drawers for Compose/Reply (boosts workflow).
- Make settings/config easily accessible: account management, integrations, AI settings.
- Responsive layout via Tailwind’s grid/flex utilities.
- GitHub issues/project board to transparently track progress.
